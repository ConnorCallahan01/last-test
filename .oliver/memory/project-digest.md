## Key Themes

Unable to identify cross-cutting themes due to empty document index data. The provided folder indexes contain no file entries, summaries, or key topics to analyze. 

**Note**: The project structure exists with 2 folders designated, but the document index tables are empty. To generate a meaningful digest, the actual document filenames, types, and content summaries are required.
